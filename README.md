# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
In this project we're helping the Colorado Board of Elections to writw a Python script that will be able to deliver the following information when is run: 

1.Calculate the Total number of votes cast
2.Get a list of candidates who received votes
3.Calculate the Total number of votes each candidate received
4.Calculate the Percentage of votes each candidate won
5.Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote
6.The voter turnout for each county
7.The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
8.The county with the highest turnout

Our final script will save the Election Results to a Text file 


### Results

After we ran the final script and based on the csv file that was provided, our results were as follow:

Total Votes: 369,711

-------------------------
Largest County Turnout: Denver
-------------------------
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)

### Election Audit Summary

Based on the python script that we built, we suggest the next modifications for make this project even useful for any election:

1. Add the column State and City to the data set so we could use the same script to get the result in national and local elections. 
2. Add the kind vote method to measure and forecast the resources needed for future elections
